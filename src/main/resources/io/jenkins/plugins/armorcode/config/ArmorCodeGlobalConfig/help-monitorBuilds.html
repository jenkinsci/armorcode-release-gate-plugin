    <p>When enabled, ArmorCode will collect information about all Jenkins jobs that match the job filter.</p>
    <p>This helps security engineers track which jobs are using ArmorCode release gates and which ones may be bypassing them.</p>
    <p>The monitoring process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Captures basic build metadata (job name, build number, result, duration)</li>
        <li>Sends data to ArmorCode after build completion</li>
        <li>Does not affect build status or performance</li>
    </ul>
