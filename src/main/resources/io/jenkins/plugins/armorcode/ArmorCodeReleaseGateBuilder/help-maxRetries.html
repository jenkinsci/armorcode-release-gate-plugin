  <p>The maximum number of times the plugin will poll the ArmorCode API for status before giving up.</p>
  <p>Because security validation may take time to complete, the plugin will continue checking until a definitive result is returned or this retry limit is reached.</p>
  <p>Each retry includes a 20-second pause between attempts when the status is "HOLD".</p>
